### Observer Pattern in Javascript

>"One or more observers are interested in the state of a subject and register their interest with the subject by attaching themselves. When something changes in our subject that the observer may be interested in, a notify message is sent which calls the update method in each observer. When the observer is no longer interested in the subject's state, they can simply detach themselves."

##### How To execute?
``` Bash
$ cd casales

$ npm run start
```
